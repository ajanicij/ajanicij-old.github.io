# Rust Breaks Into TIOBE Top-20

I am a bit late noticing this, but on June 2 Rust
[broke](https://www.infoq.com/news/2020/06/rust-top-20-language/)
into
TIOBE index top 20, for the first time.

I've been learning Rust on my free time, currently working my way
through
[Programming Rust](https://www.oreilly.com/library/view/programming-rust/9781491927274/).

Another notable news was that
[Deno Project](https://deno.land/)
[announced](https://www.infoq.com/news/2020/06/deno-1-ready-production/)
version 1.0 in May 2020. Deno was created by Ryan Dahl, who is also the
creator of Node, but is supposed to address the shortcomings of Node.
