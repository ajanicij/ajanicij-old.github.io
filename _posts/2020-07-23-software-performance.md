# Why it is important for software to be fast

The blog post by Nelson Elhage
[Reflections on software performance](https://blog.nelhage.com/post/reflections-on-performance/)
says it so well that I am only going to quote a few sentences:

> Performance is a feature

> I’ve really come to appreciate that performance isn’t just some property
of a tool independent from its functionality or its feature set.
Performance — in particular, being notably fast — is a feature in and of
its own right, which fundamentally alters how a tool is used and perceived.

> It’s probably fairly intuitive that users prefer faster software, and
will have a better experience performing a given task if the tools are
faster rather than slower.

> What is perhaps less apparent is that having faster tools changes how
users use a tool or perform a task.

This reminds me of the
[interview](https://www.computerworld.com/article/2534739/yacc--unix--and-advice-from-bell-labs-alumni-stephen-johnson.html)
with Stephen C. Johnson, creator of Yacc, in Computerworld:

> You can't rewrite a program too many times, especially if you make sure
it gets smaller and faster each time. I've seen over and over that if
something gets an order of magnitude faster, it becomes qualitatively
different. And if it is two orders of magnitude faster, it becomes
amazing. Consider what Google would be like if queries took 25 seconds
to be answered...
